# The-Mischievous-Switches-puzzle


Problem Statement:
You are in a room with three light switches, each of which controls a different light bulb in another room. However, you cannot see the light bulbs from where you are standing, and the switches are currently in the "off" position. You are only allowed to enter the room with the light bulbs once. How can you determine which light switch corresponds to each light bulb?

Solution:

Flip the first switch and leave it on for a few minutes.
After a few minutes, turn off the first switch and flip the second switch.
Enter the room with the light bulbs.
Now, you can observe the bulbs and deduce the switch positions:

The bulb that is turned on corresponds to the second switch, which you left in the "on" position.
The bulb that is turned off and still warm corresponds to the first switch, as it was turned on for a while before being switched off.
The bulb that is turned off and cool corresponds to the third switch, which was never touched.
